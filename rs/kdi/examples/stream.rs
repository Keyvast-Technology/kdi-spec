//! Acquire from a device and print records. NO HARDWARE NEEDED.
//!
//! This runs against the software device model over the UDP binding. From the repo root, in one
//! terminal:
//!
//! ```text
//! ```
//!
//! and in another:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run --example stream                 # first device found
//! cargo run --example stream -- KVDEMO       # that serial specifically
//! ```
//!
//! The server announces itself into `$KDI_DISCOVERY_DIR` (default: `kdi-discovery` under the
//! system temp dir), which is where `kdi::find` looks — so if you set that variable, set it for
//! both processes. Nothing below is transport-specific: point it at a board over `--features
//! usb3` and the same code runs.
