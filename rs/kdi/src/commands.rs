// GENERATED FROM kdi/contract.yaml BY kdi/gen.py — DO NOT EDIT.
//
// Regenerate with `make kdi-gen`. A hand edit is caught by
// kdi/tests/test_end_to_end.py::test_generated_rust_is_current, which re-renders this file and
// compares it byte-for-byte; there is no merge path for a local change.
//
// This file is COMMITTED even though the repo otherwise never tracks generated artifacts, because
// a crates.io tarball carries no Python: a consumer who cannot run the generator has to find the
// contract already compiled in.

// A TRAIT, not an inherent impl: this file is generated, so it may reach the device only through
// the one PUBLIC entry point (`Device::raw_cmd`) — no private field of `Device` and no endpoint
// number may leak into a file no human is allowed to edit, which is the same binding quarantine
// lib.rs opens with. A generated method knows a command NAME and an argument ORDER, nothing else.
//
// Why type them at all: `Device::raw_cmd` is stringly-typed, so `raw_cmd("adio.adc", &["1", "0"])`
// transposes slot and channel with no complaint (the failure kdi/frontpanel.py:80-85 documents),
// an out-of-range slot is learned a round trip later, and a misspelled name is learned on the
// wire. Every range below comes from contract.yaml and is checked BEFORE a byte is sent; the
// refusal is `HostErr::HostUnsafeArg`, which is the contract's own token for "refused by the host
// before it reached the wire" — `host_errors` is a CLOSED set and a conforming library mints none
// of its own (kdi/contract.yaml:90-94).
