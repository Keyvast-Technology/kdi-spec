//! KDI format 2 — the self-describing frame container, decoded.
//!
//! The frame carries its own geometry, so **nothing here takes a descriptor**: every length, lane
//! identity, element width and cadence is on the wire (`kdi/contract.yaml:228-249`,
//! `streams.samples.wire_layout`). A decoder needs the bytes and nothing else, which is why this
//! module stays `core`-only, allocation-free and dependency-free.
//!
//! Two things are deliberately NOT in the frame and therefore not in [`Frame`]:
//!
//! * the one cross-frame rule ([`check_run_announcements`]), kept out of [`Walk`] so a decoder's
//!   verdict cannot depend on the caller's chunk size — see that function's note;
//! * anything that interprets a `kind`'s payload. Row order, encoding and the volts-per-code scale
//!   are contract semantics (`kdi/contract.yaml:317-354`), not container semantics.
//!
//! Every rejection carries the contract's exact token (`Reject`, generated from
//! `reject_tokens`), because a third-party decoder reproducing them is the only thing the
//! published negative vectors can actually check.

// INNER attributes, so they cover this module and every descendant of it, and an inner `allow`
// cannot undo the `forbid`. This module was its own crate until the merge, and these two are the
// part of that boundary the compiler still enforces after it.
//
// `#![no_std]` did NOT survive — it is a crate attribute with no module form. What replaces it is
// `tests/codec_isolation.rs`, which asserts this module names nothing outside `core` and its own
// tree. That is a weaker guard than a manifest and it is written down as weaker: a re-export or a
// macro can hide a `std` path from it. Do not add `use std::` here on the grounds that the test is
// quiet.
