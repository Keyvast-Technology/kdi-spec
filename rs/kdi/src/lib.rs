//! KDI host library — identity-first discovery, the bind handshake, acquisition as a stream of
//! decoded records, and the typed command channel.
//!
//! Everything physical is quarantined in a PRIVATE `Link` enum. There is deliberately no public
//! `trait Transport`: a trait with one useful implementation is an abstraction nobody asked for,
//! and it would freeze a shape before a second binding exists to argue with it. The quarantine —
//! "no endpoint number appears outside the binding module" — is the property that actually
//! matters, and an enum gives it identically (`kdi/rs/README.md`, P6 is explicit future work).
//!
//! Three rules run through the whole file, each one a defect this project already shipped:
//!
//! * **A device error is DATA.** [`Device::raw_cmd`] returns `Ok(Reply)` for a well-framed reply with
//!   `rc != 0`; only a host/transport failure is `Err`. The Python reference raises
//!   `CommandError` (the Python reference host), so a caller cannot distinguish "the device said
//!   not_present" from "the link died". The generated [`Commands`] methods are the one exception
//!   and say why at [`Error::Device`]: they were asked for a value the refusal does not contain.
//! * **Enumeration errors are RETURNED.** [`find`] hands back everything it could not enumerate,
//!   because "driver present but broken" must be distinguishable from "no board"
//!   (the Python reference host catches bare `Exception` and loses that).
//! * **The wire is not the API.** A transport read is bytes, and a frame straddles two of them
//!   routinely — but that is [`StreamReader`]'s problem, not a caller's. Frame alignment, CRC,
//!   resync, reject tokens and partial-frame carry live inside this crate; [`Device::start`] hands
//!   back [`Record`]s. The decoder is the hidden [`codec`] module and no type of its appears in
//!   this crate's public API — it is an implementation detail, not a second product, and a host
//!   that had to name one of its types would be back to owning the plumbing.

// A `pub` item with no doc comment is a support ticket. This is deny rather than warn because a
// warning in a crate that already builds clean is a warning nobody sees.
