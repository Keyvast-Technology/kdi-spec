//! Acquisition: a stream as a sequence of RECORDS, not a sequence of bytes.
//!
//! This module is the reason the decoder is a hidden module rather than part of the API. Frames, CRCs,
//! magic-word resync, reject tokens, descriptor strides and partial-frame carry are all real and
//! all necessary — and every one of them is plumbing a consumer of an instrument library should
//! never have had to hold. `kdi` holds them here, once.
//!
//! Three defects paid for the shape of this file:
//!
//! * **The carry lives with the stream that owns it.** The Python reference kept both residue
//!   buffers on the CLIENT keyed by stream name, and both leaked across streams on real hardware
//!   (the Python reference host): one loudly (`crc_err` at byte 0), one silently (a `digital` read
//!   that returned rhd_matrix frames with valid CRCs and monotonic timestamps). One
//!   [`StreamReader`] owns one stream's buffer, so neither is representable.
//! * **A bad frame is COUNTED, not raised.** A recording must not die on one flipped bit. Rejected
//!   frames are resynced past and land in [`Stats::bad_frames`]; their absence still shows up in
//!   the next record's [`Record::lost_before`], from the timestamp gap. An `Err` out of
//!   [`StreamReader::next`] means the TRANSPORT failed, which is a different thing entirely.
//! * **The loss oracle is applied, not exported.** The Python reference published `lost_frames()`
//!   and a bench tool then fed it frames the HOST had already thrown away, so device loss and host
//!   loss added together. Here only the reader — which knows which frames it dropped — may ask.
